## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Implement the function `sortProduct(input)` in file **_src/exercise1.js_** where the input is an array of products with a property dateAdded in UNIX timestamp (milliseconds) format.

The function should filter product before year 2000, sort by date and group by product.

You don't understand what you need to do ?

Don't stress tests are written in file **_test/exercise1.test.js_** to explain the behaviour of the function.

To implement the function, you should do in a functional way WITHOUT using Lodash or any another FP library.

But you cloud use the moment library to manipulate dates.

* :point_right: [`moment()`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/unix-timestamp-milliseconds/)
* :point_right: [`year()`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/year/)
* :point_right: [`month()`](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/get-set/month/)

All tests describe in file **_test/exercise1.test.js_** should pass with success, and it's forbidden to change this file.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

    git add .

    git commit -m "Exercise 1"

### Exercise 2

The function `yolo(input)` in file **_src/exercise2.js_** has been implemented by an another developper and the test is present in **_test/exercise2.js_**, but he forgot to commit the input to pass the test ...

Could you guess the input "whereIsMyMind" please ? Becareful only this input should change.

The test should pass with success.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

    git add .

    git commit -m "Exercise 2"

### Exercise 3

Implement the function `meeteek(input)` in file **_src/exercise3.js_** where the input is an array of people.

The function should return an object about network relationship.

You don't understand what you need to do ?

Don't stress tests are written in file **_test/exercise3.test.js_** to explain the behaviour of the function.

To implement the function, you should do in a functional way.

You cloud use the Lodash library to help you.

* :point_right: [`includes()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#includes)
* :point_right: [`intersection()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#intersection)

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

    git add .

    git commit -m "Exercise 3"

### Exercise 4

Implement the function `countSequence(sequence, input)` in file **_src/exercise4.js_** where sequence and input are strings, the output the number of sequence into the input.

You don't understand what you need to do ?

Don't stress tests are written in file **_test/exercise4.test.js_** and they should pass with success.

Be careful the function should be able to work in a CURRY WAY too.

* :point_right: [`split()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/String/split) could help you.

After finish this exercise, please commit all your files.

    git add .

    git commit -m "Exercise 4"
